# Medium Issues

## M-1: Using `ERC721::_mint()` can be dangerous

Using `ERC721::_mint()` can mint ERC721 tokens to addresses which don't support ERC721 tokens. Use `_safeMint()` instead of `_mint()` for ERC721.

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 195](src/TSwapPool.sol#L195)

	```solidity
	        _mint(msg.sender, liquidityTokensToMint);
	```



# Low Issues

## L-1: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 2](src/Counter.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
	```



## L-2: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 2](src/Counter.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
	```

- Found in src/PoolFactory.sol [Line: 15](src/PoolFactory.sol#L15)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity 0.8.20;
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 15](src/TSwapPool.sol#L15)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity 0.8.20;
	```



# NC Issues

## NC-1: Functions not used internally could be marked external



- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 7](src/Counter.sol#L7)

	```solidity
	    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
	```

- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 11](src/Counter.sol#L11)

	```solidity
	    function increment() public {
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 298](src/TSwapPool.sol#L298)

	```solidity
	    function swapExactInput(
	```



## NC-2: Constants should be defined and used instead of literals



- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 276](src/TSwapPool.sol#L276)

	```solidity
	        uint256 inputAmountMinusFee = inputAmount * 997;
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 278](src/TSwapPool.sol#L278)

	```solidity
	        uint256 denominator = (inputReserves * 1000) + inputAmountMinusFee;
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 294](src/TSwapPool.sol#L294)

	```solidity
	            ((inputReserves * outputAmount) * 10000) /
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 295](src/TSwapPool.sol#L295)

	```solidity
	            ((outputReserves - outputAmount) * 997);
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 405](src/TSwapPool.sol#L405)

	```solidity
	            outputToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, 1_000_000_000_000_000_000);
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 457](src/TSwapPool.sol#L457)

	```solidity

## NC-3: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event PoolCreated(address tokenAddress, address poolAddress);
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 52](src/TSwapPool.sol#L52)

	```solidity
	    event LiquidityAdded(
	```

- Found in src/TSwapPool.sol [Line: 57](src/TSwapPool.sol#L57)

	```solidity
	    event LiquidityRemoved(
	```

	```solidity
	    event Swap(
